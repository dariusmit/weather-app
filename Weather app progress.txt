DONE:
1. Installed plain typescript project with Vite
2. Installed Axios
3. Installed Bulma
4. Moved script from body to head. Should it be moved to body but header tag instead?
5. Connected to API and got some data
6. Added basic error handling
7. Added input field city value grab and return data from api by that city name
8. According to city name searched app created an array and displays it


WOULD BE NICE TO IMPLEMENT:
1. ENV variable to hide api key.
